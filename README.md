## Key Features

  * **Interactive Menu:** An easy-to-use interface (`master.py`) to run various scan modes.
  * **Flexible Scan Modes:**
      * **Full Scan:** Runs all modules, deep scan, port scan, CF bypass, and auto-register.
      * **Specific Module Scan:** Allows you to run only specific modules (e.g., `xss`, `sqli`, `ssrf_internal`).
  * **In-Depth Reconnaissance:**
      * Integration with **subfinder** for subdomain discovery.
      * Integration with **httpx** to find live web servers.
  * **Dynamic Crawling:** Uses **Playwright** for deep crawling on modern (JavaScript-heavy) web applications to discover more endpoints and parameters.
  * **External Tool Integration:**
      * Uses **Nuclei** for template-based scanning.
      * Uses **Nmap** for port scanning and service detection.
  * **Bypass & Evasion:**
      * Includes CloudFlare bypass attempts (using `cloudscraper` and Playwright).
      * Uses various User-Agents and WAF Bypass payloads.
  * **Comprehensive Reporting:** Automatically generates reports in multiple formats (`.html`, `.json`, `.md`, `.csv`) in the `scan_results` directory, complete with an interactive dashboard.
  * **Configurable:** All payloads and settings (like common paths, API paths, and user agents) can be customized via the `config.json` file.
  * **Other Features:** Includes a proxy downloader, login bruteforce, and automatic user registration attempts.

## Modules (Vulnerabilities Checked)

`BugHunterPro` (`tools.py`) comes with modules to test a wide range of vulnerability categories:

  * **Broken Access Control:**
      * Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
      * Local File Inclusion (LFI)
      * Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
      * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
      * Regular SSRF checks
      * Out-of-Band (OAST) SSRF checks
      * Internal service access checks
  * **Security Misconfiguration:**
      * Missing Security Headers
      * CORS Misconfiguration
      * Insecure File Upload
      * GraphQL Introspection
      * OAuth Misconfiguration
      * Default Credentials
  * **Data Exposure & Leaks:**
      * API Token Leaks (in JS files)
      * API Endpoint Leakage
      * Session Fixation
  * **Miscellaneous:**
      * Open Redirect
      * JWT Misconfiguration
      * Prototype Pollution
      * WAF Bypass

## Installation

1.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cenmurong/bughunter
    cd bughunter
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    Make sure you have **Python 3.8+**.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install Playwright browsers:**
    (Note: Playwright is currently disabled in `misc/tools.py` but required for full functionality if re-enabled).

    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```

4.  **Install External Dependencies (REQUIRED):**
    This tool relies on several popular Go-based tools. Ensure you have [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install) and your `GOPATH` is set up correctly.

    ```bash
    # Install nuclei
    go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest

    # Install subfinder
    go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest

    # Install httpx
    go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest
    ```

    You also need **Nmap**. Install it using your system's package manager:

    ```bash
    # On Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap

    # On macOS (using Homebrew)
    brew install nmap
    ```

    **IMPORTANT:** Ensure all these binaries (`nuclei`, `subfinder`, `httpx`, `nmap`) are accessible from your system's `PATH`.

## Usage

### 1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

For a more user-friendly experience, you can use the graphical interface.

```bash
python3 master-gui.py
```
<img width="1033" height="957" alt="Screenshot from 2025-10-31 04-52-26" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d53c0554-31a8-4225-a3da-0a5ced64ce48" />

The GUI provides an easy way to:
-   **Start Scans**: Input a target URL and specific modules.
-   **Manage Processes**: Start and stop scans with dedicated buttons.
-   **View Logs**: See real-time logs directly in the application window.
-   **Download Proxies**: Update your proxy list with a single click.

### 2. Primary Usage (Interactive Menu)

Run the `master.py` script to display the menu:

```bash
python3 master.py
```
<img width="690" height="686" alt="Screenshot from 2025-10-31 05-16-06" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19636f30-5295-4912-9854-cb0abdd87f84" />

#### Menu Options

  * **[1] Scan URL (Full Scan)**

      * Asks for a target URL.
      * Runs a full scan using `tools.py` with all features enabled (`--deep-scan`).
      * You will be asked if you want to include the SSRF scan (which can be time-consuming).

  * **[2] Scan URL (Specific Module)**

      * Asks for a target URL and the name of the module to run.
      * Module examples: `xss`, `sqli`, `lfi`, `ssrf_internal`, `security_headers`.
      * See the full list of modules below or in `tools.py` (the `run_specific_module` function).

  * **[3] Gather Targets (Dorking & Indexing)**

      * Runs the `misc/indexing.py` script to gather targets based on dorks in `payloads/dork.txt`.
      * Results are saved in the `scan_results` directory.

  * **[4] Update Proxies**

      * Runs the `misc/downloader.py` script to download a new proxy list.

  * **[5] Mass Scan from Crawled URLs**

      * Runs a full scan on all URLs found in `crawled_urls.txt`.

  * **[0] Exit**

      * Exits the application.

### 2\. Advanced Usage (Directly via `tools.py`)

You can also run `tools.py` directly for more granular control.

**Example: Run a specific module with a cookie**

```bash
python3 misc/tools.py https://target.com --module xss --cookie "session=..."
```

**Example: Run multiple modules**

```bash
python3 misc/tools.py https://target.com --modules "lfi,sqli,ssti"
```

**Example: Run a full scan (like Option 2) from the command line**

```bash
python3 misc/tools.py https://target.com --deep-scan --cf-bypass --auto-register --yes
```

Use `-h` to see all available flags:

```bash
python3 misc/tools.py -h
```
```
xss, sqli, ssti, lfi, rfi, crlf, command_injection, xxe, nosql_injection, ssrf, ssrf_internal, open_redirect, csrf, idor, file_upload, cors, graphql, default_creds, oauth, security_headers, waf_bypass, api_leakage, jwt, prototype_pollution, session_fixation, api_token_leak
```
## Configuration

You can customize payloads, user-agents, and paths by editing the `config.json` file directly.
